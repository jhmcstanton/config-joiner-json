# Example Usage

This directory just contains some example data with related output\*.

## Run It 
To run this example simply use `stack exec config-joiner-json -- -c common.json -s src -t target` from this directory. If the binary is in your path then the above command is simplified to `config-joiner-json -c common.json -s src -t target`

## Examples

These files highlight some key usages of `config-joiner-json`.

### `common.json`

The `common.json` file is the file that all other configuration files share in common or inherit from. 

### `config1.json`

This is the simplest use case and simply joins a specific configuration, `config1.json`, to
the common case. There is minimal nesting of joins and no overriding of fields.

### `config2.json`

This file highlights how fields are overridden in the configuration files - when two `string`, `number`, or `array` fields have the same key `config-joiner-json` always takes the more specific field (not inherited from `common.json`). 

### `config3.json`

This file shows in more detail how `objects` are joined. 

\*The JSON in [`target`](./target) is generated by `config-joiner-json` and additionally run through a pretty printer for demonstration purposes.

Pretty printer: `cat <generated file> | python -m json.tool > tmp_json`
